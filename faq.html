            How much do lessons cost?
                Lessons would cost around 50-100$ since Kaylee is still finishing her B.A. 
            Do I need to bring my own instrument to my lesson?
                It is a good idea to bring your own horn, however if you can't provide your own horn, Kaylee will be willing to let you use hers for the duration of the lesson. 
            Where would lessons be held?
                Lessons can be held wherever you would like them to be, whether that be at your house, Kaylee's house, or a public space (With permission.).
