        <!--Questions in the page:
            How much do lessons cost?
                Lessons would cost around 50-100$ since Kaylee is still finishing her B.A. 
            Do I need to bring my own instrument to my lesson?
                It is a good idea to bring your own horn, however if you can't provide your own horn, Kaylee will be willing to let you use hers for the duration of the lesson. 
            Where would lessons be held?
                Lessons can be held wherever you would like them to be, whether that be at your house, Kaylee's house, or a public space (With permission.).

                It does depend on the person
                Lessons are a like, however many they want type deal
                Lessons can be canceled up to 24 hours before the lesson with a full refund
